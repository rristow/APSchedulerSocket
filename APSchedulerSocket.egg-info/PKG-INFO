Name: APSchedulerSocket
Version: 0.4.dev0
Summary: The purpose of the application is to solve the problem of having a unique 'APScheduler' object for a multithreaded application. The project aims to easily implement a client-server architecture to control the scheduled processes. Another great advantage is that you can use the scheduler in distributed processes or servers.
